# Introduction

- Multimorbidity (MM) is associated with great burden of the health system

- People with mental disorders (MD) have a high prevalence of MM in addition to worse quality of life, more treatment costs and premature death [@kilbourneImprovingPhysicalHealth2017]

- Half of the world's population lives in urban areas and is expected to grow to 68% by 2050 [@whoUrbanHealth2021]

- Urban areas have density. pop. greater social instability and consequently higher prevalence of violence, pollution and noise[@peenCurrentStatusUrbanrural2010]

# Specific Conditions

* Mood disorders: Heterogeneous Results
  * Major depresion twice as frequent in urban areas after controlling for socioeconomic variables[@blazerPsychiatricDisordersRural1985]
  * Canadian study found no difference in incidence[@parikhMoodDisordersRural1996]
  * Study with results grouped in first world countries, higher incidence in urban areas[@peenCurrentStatusUrbanrural2010]
* Schizophrenia and Psychosis
  * Linear growth in incidence with urbanization and 2.37 times greater risk of psychosis[@vassosMetaAnalysisAssociationUrbanicity2012]

# Specific Conditions

- Substance use:
  - No difference in prevalence in pooled results collected in first world countries[@peenCurrentStatusUrbanrural2010]

  - Higher consumption of alcoholic beverages in urban areas but similar incidence of alcohol dependence among urban and rural residents of the US[@dixonAlcoholUsePatterns2016]

- Most of the world's population lives in low-income countries and in these countries [@whoUrbanHealth2021], urbanization in these countries was faster and more chaotic in a specific political and social context[@montgomeryUrbanTransformationDeveloping2008a]

# Aim

- To compare psychiatric hospitalizations between residents of urban and rural areas in a large population, contributing to fill the gap in studies in this area in low-income countries


## Methods

- Observational, cross-sectional study with administrative data of hospital admissions in cities in the state of Bahia in Brazil from 01/2008 to 03/2017. Data were linked to Cadastro Unico (Brazilian register with all beneficiaries of any social support in the country).

- 399 cities were included (out of 415)

- 6176 adults were admitted for psychiatric treatment from 2008 to 2017

# Discussion

- Intoxication Acute alcohol abuse was the 2nd cause of hospitalization for rural women (9%) and the 5th cause for urban women

- 3% incidence of abuse and 9% dependence in the Brazilian population in Brazil [@laranjeiraAlcoholUsePatterns2009]

- AUD related to low income and close incidence in rural and urban areas in Brazil [@laranjeiraAlcoholUsePatterns2009]

- In the study Transt. for alcohol use were the most frequent diagnoses among urban and rural men

- Previous epi study in Salvador showed a higher risk of harmful use of alcohol among individuals with higher income and educational level [@almeida-filhoAlcoholDrinkingPatterns2004]

- **Therefore our finds diverge to what was reported in the past. Trends have changed?**


# Discussion

- F10-F19 ICD-10 had more subsequent hospitalizations for medical diseases (68%) and mainly for hypertension and cirrhosis of the liver caused by alcohol.

## Conclusions

- Huge burden of alcohol abuse and alcohol consumption on the public health system, with  direct  (intoxication, withdrawal symptoms) and indirect clinical consequences.

- High alcohol use among rural women.
